Everyone wants to do multi-omics to reveal mechanisms behind microbiome interactions.\nHowever, the set of tools to do that is very limited.\nMoreover, even if there are methods, they are usually not user-friendly (specific input, lack of documentation etc)\nThirdly, there are available large databases, but there is large gap between databases and computational tools. Meaning that you have to download the data, wrangle it into specific format and then run analysis, which is not very practical."
