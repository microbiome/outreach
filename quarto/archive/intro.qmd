::: {.column width="70%"}
**Introduction to R/Bioconductor, a popular open-source environment for life science informatics, with a focus on microbiome analysis**

After the course, you will know how to:

-   organize your data into a coherent data science framework

-   implement reproducible data science workflows

-   approach common analysis tasks with available documentation and R tools

## Target audience

-   Advanced MSc, PhD & postdoctoral researchers who wish to learn new skills in scientific programming

-   Earlier experience with R is expected

Welcome!

## Code of Conduct {.smaller}

Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes

-   sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise

-   collaboration

-   diversity and inclusivity

-   a kind and welcoming environment

-   community contributions

By participating in this community, you agree not to engage in behavior contrary to these values at any Bioconductor-sponsored event or electronic communication channel.

For the full CoC, see: [https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual](https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/)

## Schedule

-   Day 1: data science framework

-   Day 2: data analysis & visualization

-   Day 3: break from hands-on

-   Day 4-5: advanced topics

## Session types

-   **Short lectures & demonstrations** don't hesitate to ask questions!

-   **Practicals** Solve tasks by taking advantage of the online examples and resources that are pointed out in the material. There is often more than one way to solve a given task.

-   **Additional exercises** & example data sets, supporting online material, many ways to solve a given task

-   **Presentations**, present your solutions, highlight questions and challenges

## Teaching material

-   Teaching follows the open online book (beta version) created by the course teachers, [Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA).

-   The openly licensed teaching material, exercises and slides will be available online during and after the course.

## Support

-   Post-it stickers

-   Online chat (GitHub Discussions) <https://github.com/microbiome/OMA/discussions>

-   [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEQ2d5g-zMoANhtHGbcKbW4DhElovPHz6iChjSX6Md8/edit?usp=sharing) **Questions at the end of the gdoc are welcome**

-   Feedback at the end of each day using minute cards

## Other points

-   Basic vs. advanced groups
-   Working with your own data?

**If you need a small break, take it!**

## Acknowledgments

Development work has received support from several sources.

## Learning goals for *today*

Broader context and practical skills on:

-   **Data science workflow**: setting up reproducible data science workflows with Quarto

-   **Data containers**: understanding *SummarizedExperiment*

-   **Basic data wrangling** (e.g. subsetting, aggregation)
