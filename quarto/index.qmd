## Contributions

You are welcome to add new presentations or improve the current ones. The guidelines for contributors are explained [here](https://github.com/microbiome/OMA#development-and-contributions). The presentations are deployed from the [quarto sub-directory](https://github.com/microbiome/outreach/blob/main/quarto/), so you need to make the respective changes there and run `cd quarto/; quarto render`.

The following is a quick workflow for contributions:

1.  fork the repository

2.  add your qmd file(s) to the [quarto sub-directory](https://github.com/microbiome/outreach/blob/main/quarto/)

3.  update the [\_quarto.yml file](https://github.com/microbiome/outreach/blob/main/quarto/_quarto.yml) and the list of presentations in the [website](https://github.com/microbiome/outreach/blob/main/quarto/index.qmd) with the name of the qmd file(s) with your presentation(s)

4.  run `quarto render` from your terminal from within the quarto sub-directory

5.  and make a pull request to the master branch
