## Origins

While attending workshops at EuroBioc2023, I got to play with iSEE.

## iSEE

iSEE is a very nice app that lets you visualise SummarizedExperiment objects
in an interactive way [@rue2018isee]. However it had no support for ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ .

## iSEEtree

So we thought why not adding support for ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ , and we developed iSEEtree to
visualise TreeSummarizedExperiment objects in an interactive way
[@benedetti2024iseetree].

## Half-way there!

iSEEtree is very nice, but why not having a graphical user interface with full
mia functionality, from importing data to plotting results?

## miaDash

An app that translates the mia functionality to a graphical user interface.
