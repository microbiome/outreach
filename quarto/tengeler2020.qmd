## Tengeler2020

[Tengeler2020](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/reference/mia-datasets.html) is a randomised blinded study on the effects of gut microbiome on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in humanised mice [@Tengeler2020].

Young, male, germ-free C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice (n = 27) were humanised with gut microbiome from either ADHD patients (n = 3) or healthy controls (n = 3) of matched age. Notably, the mice belonged to three different cohorts.

#| label: tab-pop
tab <- table(colData(tse)$patient_status, colData(tse)$cohort)
colnames(tab) <- c("Cohort1", "Cohort2", "Cohort3")
knitr::kable(tab)
```

## Research Question

Given its developmental importance and its association with several psichiatric disorders, does the gut microbiome alter brain structure, function or behaviour in ADHD?

## Study Design

Microbiome data was obtained by **16S rRNA gene sequencing** of bacterial DNA sampled from faecal pellet on a weekly basis. Then, sequence reads were assembled into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with an NG-Tax pipeline.

In addition to microbiome analysis, during the experimental period mice underwent multiple **behavioural tests** (OFT, MBT and NOR) and **neurophysiological measurements** (MRI and perfusion), creating the opportunity to perform a **multiomic analysis**.

## Community Diversity

The profile of the ADHD-related microbiome community showed minor differences from the control in terms of **alpha diversity**, but the two groups could be distinguished in terms of **beta diversity**.

## Correlation Analysis

Some taxa were significantly correlated with neurobiological features.

## Brain and Behaviour

Compared to healthy mice, ADHD mice exhibited more anxiety in OFT and less functional connectivity in the right visuomotor system.
