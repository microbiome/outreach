## Reproducible reporting

- To create human-readable reports
- Transparency, reusability and reproducibility
- Debugging

::: {.notes}

In microbiome research, workflows often involve many custom scripts and datasets. Standardized, reproducible reporting ensures results can be verified, reused, and built upon.

## Literate programming

Programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth (1984) in which a computer program is given as an explanation of its logic in a natural language, embedded with code chunks, from which compilable source code can be generated.\
(Adapted from *Wikipedia*)

::: {.notes}

Literate programming emphasizes writing code for humans first, allowing the logic to be explained clearly, with the computer code embedded for execution.

## Reproducible notebooks

- We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for reproducible documentation.
- Next generation development of Rmarkdown
- Supported by RStudio

::: {.notes}

Quarto allows combining narrative, code, and results in a single reproducible document, ideal for microbiome workflows.

You can do slides, book, websites, ...

Compared to RMarkdown, better support for other langauges. You can use SQL, Python and Julia along with R in same document.

## Demonstration

::: {.notes}

Show how to open file in RStudio.

What are code chunks and how to write text.

How to render?
