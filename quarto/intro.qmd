::: {.notes}

This course introduces mia (microbiome analysis) framework within Bioconductor.

Central to Bioconductor is data containers. TreeSummarizedExperiment data container and methods.

Get to know the participants.

:::


## Code of Conduct {.smaller}

Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes

-   sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise

-   collaboration

-   diversity and inclusivity

-   a kind and welcoming environment

-   community contributions

By participating in this community, you agree not to engage in behavior contrary to these values at any Bioconductor-sponsored event or electronic communication channel.

## Schedule {visibility="visible"}

**Day 1 &mdash; Mon**: Introduction to Bioconductor framework

**Day 2 &mdash; Tue**: Data wrangling

**Day 3 &mdash; Wed**: Community diversity & composition

**Day 4 &mdash; Thu**: Statistical testing

**Day 5 &mdash; Fri**: Advanced topics

::: {.notes}

Overview of the week

:::

## Practicalities

- Each topic: **short lecture + demonstration**
- Majority of time: **hands-on practice**
- Materials follow the "Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis" [OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)
- Slack channel: for real-time support
-   The openly licensed teaching material will be available online during and after the course

::: {.notes}
Hands-on learning is the focus — you’ll learn best by doing.
Feel free to interrupt and ask questions anytime.
The OMA book is a lasting resource you can return to.

You should do hands-on with your local computer. Have you installed packages? --> Help is provided when doing first exercises.
RStudio is recommended along with Quarto/RMarkdown, but plain R files are ok if you are familiar with them.

## Questions

- What are `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("mia")` and [OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)?

- How microbiome data science is conducted in 
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` ecosystem?

- What benefits this new ecosystem have compared to previous approaches?

::: {.notes}

These are the questions that you might have at this point. Hopefully, I am able to answer them during the week.

mia is the package family and OMA is the online book and ecosystem.

How this SummarizedExperiment ecosystem is applied to microbiome data science and what benefits it has compared to other approaches, including custom scripts, phyloseq and other data containers.

## Learning goals {visibility="visible"}


After the course, you will know how to:


- **Analyze microbiome data** using the Bioconductor's `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` ecosystem  

- **Implement reproducible workflows**

- **Explore documentation & tools** via the [OMA book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)

::: {.notes}

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to apply SE-based methods, create meaningful plots, and know where to go for further learning.

## Learning goals for *today*

Broader context and practical skills on:


-   **Bioconductor ecosystem** 

-   **Data containers**: understanding *SummarizedExperiment*

- **Importing data**: how to get your data imported in R
