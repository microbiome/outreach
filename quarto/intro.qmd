::: {.notes}

This course introduces mia (microbiome analysis) framework within Bioconductor.

Central to Bioconductor is data containers. TreeSummarizedExperiment data container and methods.

Get to know the participants.

Overview of the week

## Practicalities

- Each topic: **short lecture + demonstration**  
- Majority of time: **hands-on practice**  
- Materials follow the [OMA online book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)  

::: {.notes}
Hands-on learning is the focus — you’ll learn best by doing.  
Feel free to interrupt and ask questions anytime.  
The OMA book is a lasting resource you can return to.

You should do hands-on with your local computer. Have you installed packages? --> Help is provided when doing first exercises.
RStudio is recommended along with Quarto/RMarkdown, but plain R files are ok if you are familiar with them.

## Questions

- What are `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("mia")` and [OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)?
- How microbiome data science is conducted in `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` ecosystem?
- What benefits this new ecosystem have compared to previous approaches?

::: {.notes}

These are the questions that you might have at this point. Hopefully, I am able to answer them during the week.

mia is the package family and OMA is the online book and ecosystem.

How this SummarizedExperiment ecosystem is applied to microbiome data science and what benefits it has compared to other approaches, including custom scripts, phyloseq and other data containers.

:::

## Objectives

- **Analyze microbiome data** using the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` ecosystem  
- **Create & interpret visualizations**  
- **Explore documentation & tools** via the [OMA book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/)  

::: {.notes}

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to apply SE-based methods, create meaningful plots, and know where to go for further learning.
