## Code of Conduct {.smaller}

Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes

-   sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise

-   collaboration

-   diversity and inclusivity

-   a kind and welcoming environment

-   community contributions

By participating in this community, you agree not to engage in behavior contrary to these values at any Bioconductor-sponsored event or electronic communication channel.

For the full CoC, see: [https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual](https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/)

## Target audience

-   Focus on multi-omic data integration, with emphasis on microbiome research

-   Advanced MSc, PhD & postdoctoral researchers who wish to learn new skills in scientific programming and multi-omic data analysis

-   Earlier experience with R is expected

-   [Participants & wishlists](https://tinyurl.com/oulubioc2023)

## Learning goals  {.smaller}

::: {.column width="70%"}
**Introduction to multi-omic data integration and analysis with R/Bioconductor, a popular open-source environment for life science informatics.**

After the course, you will know how to:

-   organize multiple data sources into a coherent data science framework

-   implement open & reproducible data science workflows

-   approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools

Primary focus: microbiome research; methods are generally applicable to transcriptomics, metabolomics, single cell sequencing and other omics integration.

## Schedule

-   Day 1: open data science framework

-   Day 2: tabular data analysis (single omics)

-   Day 3: multi-table data analysis (multi-omics)

## Schedule

## Session types

-   **Lectures, demonstrations** don't hesitate to ask questions!

-   **Practicals** Solve tasks by taking advantage of the online examples and resources that are pointed out in the material. There is often more than one way to solve a given task.

-   **Additional exercises** & example data sets, supporting online material, many ways to solve a given task

-   **Presentations**, present your solutions, highlight questions and challenges, engage the audience

## Teaching material

-   Teaching follows the open online book (beta version) created by the course teachers, [Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA).

-   The openly licensed teaching material, exercises and slides will be available online during and after the course.

## Support

-   Post-it stickers

## Learning goals for *today*

Broader context and practical skills on:

-   **Open data science workflow**: setting up reproducible data science workflows with Quarto

-   **Data containers**: understanding *SummarizedExperiment*

-   **Basic data wrangling** (e.g. subsetting, aggregation)
