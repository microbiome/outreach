R and Bioconductor provide a generic framework for statistical analysis and visualization, as well as specialized data classes for a variety of high-throughput data types, but methods are lacking for integrative analysis of multiomics experiments. The {MultiAssayExperiment} software package, implemented in R and leveraging Bioconductor software and design principles, provides for the coordinated representation of, storage of, and operation on multiple diverse genomics data. We provide the unrestricted multiple 'omics data for each cancer tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas as ready-to-analyze {MultiAssayExperiment} objects and demonstrate in these and other datasets how the software simplifies data representation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The {MultiAssayExperiment} Bioconductor package reduces major obstacles to efficient, scalable, and reproducible statistical analysis of multiomics data and enhances data science applications of multiple omics datasets.

However, the discovery and comparison of these {MAG} collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed {MGnify} Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific non-redundant microbial genome catalogues generated using {MAGs} and publicly available isolate genomes. Genomes within a biome-specific catalogue are organised into species clusters. For species that contain multiple conspecific genomes, the highest quality genome is selected as the representative, always prioritising an isolate genome over a {MAG}. The species representative sequences and annotations can be visualised on the {MGnify} website and the full catalogue and associated analysis outputs can be downloaded from {MGnify} servers. A suite of online search tools is provided allowing users to compare their own sequences, ranging from a gene to sets of genomes, against the catalogues. Seven biomes are available currently, comprising over 300,000 genomes that represent 11,048 non-redundant species, and include 36 taxonomic classes not currently represented by cultured genomes. {MGnify} Genomes is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/browse/genomes/.}

	abstract = {Previous benchmarking of differential abundance (DA) analysis methods in microbiome studies have employed synthetic data, simulations, and {\textquotedblleft}real data{\textquotedblright} examples, but to the best of our knowledge, none have yet employed experimental data with known {\textquotedblleft}ground truth{\textquotedblright} differential abundance. A key debate in the field centers on whether compositional methods are necessary for DA analysis, which is challenging to answer due to the lack of ground truth data. To address this gap, we created the Bioconductor data package MicrobiomeBenchmarkData, featuring three microbiome datasets with established biological ground truths: 1) diverse oral microbiomes from supragingival and subgingival plaques, expected to favor aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, respectively, 2) low-diversity microbiomes from healthy vaginas and bacterial vaginosis, conditions that have been well-characterized through cell culture and microscopy, and 3) a spike-in dataset with constant, known absolute abundances of three bacteria. We benchmarked 17 DA approaches and demonstrated that compositional DA methods are not beneficial but rather lack sensitivity, show increased variability in constant-abundance spike-ins, and, most surprisingly, more frequently produce paradoxical results with DA in the wrong direction for the low-diversity microbiome. Conversely, commonly used methods in microbiome literature, such as LEfSe, the Wilcoxon test, and RNA-seq-derived methods, performed best. We conclude that researchers continue using widely adopted non-parametric or RNA-seq DA methods and that further development of compositional methods includes benchmarking against datasets with known biological ground truth.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
