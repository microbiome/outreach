## Motivation

### Microbiome research

-   Microbiome is a composition of microbes in well-defined area (gut, skin, mouth...)
-   Bilateral interaction between human and microbiome --> affects both health and disease
-   The research is based on sequencing (characterization of genes and species)
    -   Multiomics approach has become more common (integration of taxonomy information with metabolite data, for example)
-   The research has expanded rapidly in previous years

```{r pubmed_fig, fig.width=6, fig.cap="PubMed publications per year with a search term 'microbiome' (fetched: Sep 5, 2023)", class.source = 'fold-hide'}
# Plot publication graph
path <- "data/PubMed_Timeline_Results_by_Year.csv"
df <- read.csv(path, skip = 1)

x <- "Year"
y <- "Count"

plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = .data[[x]], y = .data[[y]])) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
plot
```

### Big data

-   Cohort datasets are large in size
    -   Data management, handling and wrangling --\> data containers
    -   Computational power --\> High performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing
-   *[MultiAssayExperiment (MAE)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)* and *[SummarizedExperiment (SE)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)*
    -   Several R packages frameworks are increasingly integrating *MAE* and *SE*
    -   *MAE* enables linking of multiple experiments
    -   *SE* -- and especially *TreeSE* -- is an efficient data container for handling data from an experiment

## The workflow

The workflow is based on [Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) tutorial book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/).
Find more information from there.

### Importing the dataset

We fetch the data from [MGnify database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics).
It is a EMBL-EBI's database for metagenomic data. This large microbiome database
can be accessed with *MGnifyR* package which nowadays support *TreeSE*.
The package will be submitted to Bioconductor in the next release.

We chose the dataset from the [study MGYS00005128](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00005128#overview).
In this study, they studied antibiotic resistance. They collected data from
Cambodia, Kenya and UK. The dataset contains total of 1197 samples with taxonomy
and gene function prediction data.

Because loading takes some time, the dataset is already loaded.

```{r import1}
# library(MGnifyR)
# # Create a client object
# mg <- MgnifyClient(useCache = TRUE, cacheDir = "data/magnifyr_cache")
# # Search analysis IDs based on study ID 
# analyses <- searchAnalysis(mg, "studies", "MGYS00005128")
# # Fetch data
# mae <- getResult(mg, analyses, get.func = "go-slim")
# # Store the data
# saveRDS(mae, "data/mae.Rds")
```

```{r import2}
mae <- readRDS("data/mae.Rds")
```

### The data containers

*MAE* stores multiple experiments, in this case two (taxonomy and gene function prediction data).

```{r data_container1}
mae
```

We can have general information on samples of the study in sample metadata (*colData* slot) of *MAE*.

```{r data_container2}
colData(mae) %>% head(c(5,5)) %>% kable()
```

*MAE* and *TreeSE* objects have rows and columns. This means that we can subset the
data similarly to other objects that have rows and columns (like *data.frame*).
In *MAE*, experiments and samples are linked together, meaning that we can subset
the data at one go (you don't have to keep record on order of samples between experiments).

For demonstrative purpose and for saving computational resources, let's subset the data by
taking 100 random samples. 

```{r data_container3}
set.seed(49585)
random_samples <- sample(colnames(mae[[1]]), 100)
mae <- mae[, random_samples]
mae
```

The first experiment / *TreeSE* includes taxonomy information.

```{r data_container4}
mae[[1]]
```

The second one includes gene function prediction data. As you can see, we can
fetch the data by specifying index or name of experiment.

```{r data_container5}
mae[["go-slim"]]
```

Taxonomy data includes phylogenetic table in its feature metadata (*rowData* slot).

```{r data_container6}
rowData(mae[[1]]) %>% head() %>% kable()
```

Compared to *phyloseq* object, *TreeSE* can hold more data, for example, multiple
assays. Let's transform the data. Transformed table is stored to *assays* slot.

```{r data_container7}
mae[[1]] <- transformAssay(mae[[1]], method = "relabundance")
mae[[1]]
```

### Summarize data

We can summarize how many unique bacteria there in in certain taxonomy levels.
For instance, we can see that there are 53 unique bacterial phyla.

```{r summarize1}
rowData(mae[[1]]) %>% as_tibble() %>% summarise_all(n_distinct) %>% kable()
```

A common operation in microbiome data analysis is agglomeration. This means
that we sum-up the data to certain taxonomy levels. We can use
*mia::mergeFeaturesByRank* function for agglomerating data to single
taxonomy level. If we want to agglomerate the data to all found taxonomy levels
with one command, we can use *mia::splitByRanks*.

*altExps* slot is the right place to store experiments with modified features
(such as agglomerated or subsetted data).

```{r summarize2}
altExps(mae[[1]]) <- splitByRanks(mae[[1]])
mae[[1]]
```

We can fetch agglomerated data from the slot We can see that instead of 2207
features, there is only 5 features in the data that is summed-up to kingdom level.

(NOTE: *altExp*, not *altExps*. The latter is a list and the first is for fetching
data from the list. Similarly to *assay* and *assays*.)

```{r summarize3}
altExp(mae[[1]], "Kingdom")
```

*assays* include agglomerated abundance tables.

```{r summarize4}
assay(altExp(mae[[1]], "Kingdom"), "counts") %>% head(c(5,5)) %>% kable()
```

To visualize phylogenetic relations (here in family level), we can first create a phylogenetic tree
based on *rowData*. The tree is stored in *rowTree* slot. miaverse includes also
methods for plotting trees.

```{r summarize5}
altExp(mae[[1]], "Family") <- addTaxonomyTree(altExp(mae[[1]], "Family"))
plotRowTree(altExp(mae[[1]], "Family"), edge_colour_by = "Kingdom")
```

In addition to plotting trees, miaverse includes several other visualizing methods.
For example, we can visualize relative abundances of 10 most abundant phyla.

```{r summarize6}
plotAbundanceDensity(
    altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum"), assay.type = "relabundance", n = 10, layout="density") 
```

### Alpha diversity

Alpha diversity measures how diverse the microbial composition is in a sample. For example,
if there are lots of different bacterial species, the alpha diversity is higher.
Again, miaverse includes convenient tools to calculate alpha diversities of samples
and to visualize them.

Here we analyze if alpha diversities differ between locations.

```{r alpha}
# Calculate
mae[[1]] <- estimateDiversity(mae[[1]], index = "shannon")
# Plot
plotColData(mae[[1]], y = "shannon", x = "location", colour_by = "location") +
    # These are normal ggplot objects
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Beta diversity

Beta diversity measures differences and similarities of microbial profiles between samples.
There are several techniques Principal Component Analysis (PCA) being the most well-known
ordination method. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) is supervised
ordination method which takes into account sample metadata. It maximizes the
variance with respect to covariates.

Here we analyze if location can explain the differences in microbial profile.
The result is stored to *reducedDim* slot.

```{r beta1}
mae[[1]] <- runRDA(
    mae[[1]],
    assay.type = "relabundance",
    formula = data ~ location,
    distance = "bray",
    name = "dbRDA"
)

reducedDim(mae[[1]], "dbRDA")
```

As we can see, location has significant effect on microbial profile. However,
from above we can see that groups do not have similar variance which is an
assumption of PERMANOVA. This has to be taken into account when making conclusions.

```{r beta2}
plotRDA(mae[[1]], "dbRDA", colour_by = "location")
```

### Differential abundance analysis (DAA)

The idea of DAA is to analyze, if there are individual bacteria whose abundance differ
between groups. There are multiple methods to test this (such as basic Wilcoxon test).
[ANCOM-BC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17041-7) is a method
that takes into consideration unique characters and features of microbial data.

Here we want to test if there are phyla whose abundance differ between locations.

```{r daa1}
# Analyze
res <- ancombc2(
    data =  altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum"),
    fix_formula = "location",
    p_adj_method = "fdr",
    group = "location",
    global = TRUE
)
# Store results to data container
metadata( altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum") )[["ancombc2"]] <- res
# Print
temp <- res$res_global
temp %>% kable()
```

```{r daa2}
# Add results to feature metadata
# Ensure that results go to right feature
rownames(temp) <- temp$taxon
temp <- temp[rownames(altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum")), ]
rownames(temp) <- rownames( altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum") )
# Add to rowData
rowData(altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum")) <- cbind(rowData(altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum")), temp)
```

We can visualize statistically significant features with boxplot. 

```{r daa3, fig.width=12}
# Get the data from assay, rowData and colData
df <- meltAssay(
    altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum"), assay.type = "relabundance",
    add_col_data = TRUE, add_row_data = TRUE)
# Take only significant features
df <- df[ df$diff_abn, ]
# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = location, colour = location, y = relabundance)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
    # Own panel for each feature
    facet_grid(cols = vars(FeatureID)) +
    # Remove x axis text
    theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank()) +
    # Logarithmic scale
    scale_y_log10()
```

### Cross-correlation

To demonstrate, how we can integrate experiments, we perform simple cross-correlation
analysis. The purpose is to analyze, if there are phyla whose abundance correlates
with predicted gene functions.

First we subset the gene function prediction data by taking only those features
whose abundance varies the most across samples.

```{r crosscorr1}
# Transform assay
mae[[2]] <- transformAssay(mae[[2]], method = "log10", pseudocount = 1)
mae[[2]] <- transformAssay(mae[[2]], assay.type = "log10", method = "z", name = "log10_z")
# Get coefficient of variances
rowData(mae[[2]])[["cv"]] <- apply( assay(mae[[2]], "log10_z"), 1, function(x) sd(x)/mean(x) )
# Subset the data by taking top 40 features
top_feat <- order(abs(rowData(mae[[2]])[["cv"]]), decreasing = TRUE)[1:40]
altExp(mae[[2]], "sub") <- mae[[2]][top_feat, ]
# Replace feature names with more desriptive names
rownames(altExp(mae[[2]], "sub") ) <- rowData(altExp(mae[[2]], "sub"))[["description"]]
# Print
altExp(mae[[2]], "sub")
```

```{r crosscorr2, fig.width=13, fig.height=12}
# Transform assay of microbial data
altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum") <- transformAssay(altExp(mae[[1]], "Phylum"), method = "clr", pseudocount = 1)
# Perform cross-correlation analysis
res <- testExperimentCrossAssociation(
    mae,
    experiment1 = 1, experiment2 = 2,
    altexp1 = "Phylum", altexp2 = "sub",
    assay.type1 = "clr", assay.type = "log10_z",
    mode = "matrix"
)
# Store the result to data container
metadata(mae)[["croscor"]] <- res
# Plot
plot <- Heatmap(
    res$cor, name = "Kendall's tau",
    # Print values to cells
    cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) {
        # If the p-value is under threshold
        if( !is.na(res$p_adj[i, j]) & res$p_adj[i, j] < 0.05 ){
            # Print "X"
            grid.text(sprintf("%s", "X"), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, col = "black"))
            }
        },
    column_names_rot = 45
    )
# Adjust padding around plot so that names are visible
draw(plot, padding = unit(c(10, 40, 2, 2), "mm"))
```

### Save the results

Finally, we can save the data container which contains our analysis results.

```{r save}
saveRDS(mae, "data/mae_results.Rds")
```
